CREATING CUSTOM RESOURCES FOR YOUR HOUSES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When editing a house, you can create custom resources for it by creating a ZIP
archive with the name of the house .gpf and .gpd files and giving it a .gpa
extension.  This is referred to as a "resource archive."

Within a resource archive, you can place resources in a subfolder named after
the resource type, and resource files within the subfolder with a specified
ID.

Supported resource types and their corresponding folder names:
"icl4":   32x32 4-bit-per-pixel icon graphics in BMP format.
"icl8":   32x32 8-bit-per-pixel icon graphics in BMP format.
"ICN$23": 32x64 black and white icon graphics and masks.  The top half of the
          image is the image, and bottom half is the mask.  The mask should
		  be white for transparent pixels and black for opaque pixels.
"ics4":   16x16 4-bit-per-pixel icon graphics in BMP format.
"ics8":   16x16 8-bit-per-pixel icon graphics in BMP format.
"ics$23": 16x32 black and white icon graphics and masks.  The top half of the
          image is the image, and bottom half is the mask.  The mask should
		  be white for transparent pixels and black for opaque pixels.
"PICT":   BMP format images.
"snd$20": Sounds in 8-bit mono unsigned 22254Hz WAV format.


For example, to create a custom image with the resource ID 1200, create a BMP
format image named "1200.bmp" and place it in the "PICT" directory inside of
the resource archive.

IDs can range from -32768 to 32767.

To create a custom icon, create an "icl8" or "ICN$23" resource with the ID
-16455.


PACKAGING YOUR HOUSE FOR DISTRIBUTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To package a house for single-file distribution, use the "MergeGPF" tool to
combine the metadata, house data, and resources into a single GPF file.  Doing
this will make your house read-only, so make a copy first!

If you accidentally make your house read-only by doing this, then you can
return it to an editable state via the following steps:
- Open the GPF file using a ZIP archive tool.
- Extract the "!data" file from the GPF and change it to the name of the house
  with a ".gpd" extension.
- If the house has any custom resources, then duplicate the GPF file and rename
  it to the house name with a ".gpa" extension, then open it with a ZIP archive
  tool and remove the "!!meta" and "!data" files from the ".gpa" archive.
- Remove the "!data" file and any custom resources from the GPF file.

Alternately, you can export a house to play with the original Glider PRO by
using the "Export Glider PRO House..." option in the Import/Export menu.  Doing
this will output a MacBinary file to the "Export" subdirectory of the "Aerofoil"
directory in your Documents directory.
